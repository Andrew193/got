        <h3>Why are you here?</h3>
        <p>
          In the north, there is eternal darkness and cold winds. The Night's Watch is the shield
          that protects the realms of men. You join the ranks of those who stand on the Wall, patrol
          abandoned fortresses, and love order more than warm hearths.

          Immediately after this window, you'll choose your first hero—the leader of a small squad.
          Each has their own specialization, skill tree, and starting equipment.

          "Night gathers, and my watch begins. It will not end until I die. I will take no wife, no
          lands, no father to children. I will wear no crown, nor seek glory. I will live and die at
          my post. I am a sword in the darkness, I am a watchman on the Wall, I am the fire that
          drives away the cold, I am the light that brings dawn, I am the horn that wakes the
          sleeping, I am the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life and honor to the
          Night's Watch this night, and all that will come."
